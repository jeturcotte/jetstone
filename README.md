A new 24x24 Dwarf Fortress Tileset and raw files.  Now that retina screens are a thing, we have the option to have slightly nicer tiles for use in playing dwarf fortress.  Further, as of mid-2016, it doesn't seem like most of the tileset makers are keeping up with compatibility.  So, here's a new one.

If you intend to fork or contribute to this project, be aware of the following link, as it helps a great deal in assessing what to do with each tile within the limits we have set upon us.
